### Searching for Players

If you have many players, use the search box to quickly find who you're looking for.

### How Many Players?

- The app works best with 8-16 players
- You need at least 4 players to generate a schedule (one doubles game)
- More courts = more players can play simultaneously

---

## Weekly Schedule Management

Each season is divided into weeks. For each week, you'll:
1. Set player availability
2. Generate the schedule
3. (On game day) Enter scores

### Navigating Weeks

- Use the **Week Navigation** arrows to move between weeks
- The current week is highlighted
- You can jump to any week directly

### Setting Player Availability

Before generating a schedule, mark which players are available that week:

1. Open the week you want to schedule
2. Click **Availability**
3. For each player, mark them as:
   - **Available** (green) - They can play
   - **Unavailable** (red) - They can't make it
4. Changes save automatically

### Generating the Schedule

Once availability is set:

1. Click **Generate Schedule**
2. The app will automatically:
   - Pair players into doubles teams
   - Assign teams to courts
   - Create multiple rounds if needed
   - Try to give everyone equal playing time
   - Avoid repeating partnerships when possible
3. Review the generated schedule
4. If you don't like it, click **Regenerate** for a different arrangement
5. When satisfied, click **Finalize Schedule**

### Understanding the Schedule View

The schedule shows:
- **Round**: Which round of play (Round 1, Round 2, etc.)
- **Court**: Which court the game is on
- **Teams**: The two doubles teams (Player A & Player B vs Player C & Player D)
- **Byes**: Players sitting out that round (if odd numbers)

## Tips & Tricks

### Before the Season

1. Add all potential players to your Player Pool first
2. Create the season with the correct number of weeks
3. Add players to the season roster as they confirm participation

### Each Week

1. **A few days before**: Contact players to confirm availability
2. **Day before**: Update availability in the app and generate the schedule
3. **Morning of**: Print score sheets and the schedule
4. **During play**: Have someone record scores on the printed sheets
5. **After play**: Enter scores into the app

### Managing Substitutes

If a player can't make it last minute:
1. Update their availability to "Unavailable"
2. Regenerate the schedule
3. If you have a sub, add them to the roster first, mark them available, then regenerate

### Best Practices

- **Finalize schedules** the day before to give players time to see matchups
- **Enter scores promptly** so the leaderboard stays current
- **Check the leaderboard** periodically to ensure data looks correct
- **Export PDFs** as backups of your season data
