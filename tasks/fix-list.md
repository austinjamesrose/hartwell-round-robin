Score Entry UI: 
    -score entry UI at current state shows all games, all rounds in one long list. A drop down for each round would make it easier to input scores. 
    -user should be able to input score of a single game and save on that game to prevent lost progress
Season UI: 
    -when clicking into the Season, the page is just one long page with all elements (players, add player, week schedule, leaderboard) with no navigation. -Navigation should be used for the different features, with buttons for "Roster", "Schedule", "Manage Active Week", and "Leaderboard". 
Roster: 
    -current roster view is just a long list of players - once players are added, you should be able to navigate a drop down that makes it less on the page. 
PDF Export for Manual Score Capture
    There needs to be a PDF Export Option once the schedule is finalized, so admin can print out copies for each court and the teams can write the score for their game on the sheet of paper.
